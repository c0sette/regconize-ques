Consider the following argument:

The Artape people have lived on the island of Staples for between 20,000 and 25,000 years. A number of
archaeological sites have been radiocarbon dated to around 19,000 BC, although there is evidence of some
tools being used by hunters as early as 23,000 BC. They are thought to have migrated across from Africa on
land bridges that existed belore the last ice age. Archaeological evidence, such as oral stories, rock pictures
and some ancient fossils, suggests that there was trade between the main land and the smaller island across
these land bridges, but this stopped when the seas rose around 12,000 years ago.*
