Conversation analysis is a well-defined method and school of thought that analyses language from a social
perspective. It seeks to study naturally occurring talk, either in everyday conversations or institutional settings
such as schools and organizations. Any conversation analysis must be strictly based on the actual
conversation, and outside categories (such as the race or class of the speaker) cannot be imposed unless
they are referred to in the conversation being analyzed. Conversation analysts seek lo find out what actions
are performed by speakers in conversation (e.g. telling stories, making arrangements), and how they organize
their talk in order to do that. They use a special mode of analysis to understand how actions are performed in
talk called the next turn proof procedure. In this procedure, the action of the speaker is understood by
examining how the following speaker understood them. When discussing the organization of talk,
conversation analysts use terms such as turns, sequence organization and repair (how speakers fix errors in
their talk).
