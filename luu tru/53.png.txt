Consider the following problem:

“The building manager for a brand-new apartment building in the center of the city has been receiving
complaints about how slow the elevators are. As the building is still under construction, the problem is the
worst at peak hour when the workers use the lifts to bring their tools and materials up to the top floors,
however he still gets a lot of complaints at other times. The building manager decides to hire a work crew to
come in and try and speed up the elevators, but unfortunately, they tell him it isn’t possible.

The construction won't be finished for another fewt months, so he needs to figure out how to get the elevators
to work faster. It is starting to stress him out and the residents are getting more annoyed.

On the day that the construction crew bring in the mirrors for the apartments on level 11, he notices that he
receives no complaints. The complaints start up again the next day, but oddly when the mirrors are delivered
for level 12 there are no complaints either.

The manager suddenly realizes how he can reduce the number of complaints and installs mirrors next to the
elevators on each floor. He also installs mirrors in each of the elevators and now only receives only one
complaint a month.”
