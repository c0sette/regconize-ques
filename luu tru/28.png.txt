Consider the following rhetorical situation.

A student is having some financial difficulties and needs to work full-time and save money. They are unable to
study while they are working, and the student needs to defer for half a year. They go to the student support
centre in their university, and talk to an administrative staff member about their options. The student support
centre is organised like a bank or other customer support centre, with officers sitting at individual desks and
university marketing material on the walls. The staff member consults texts on their computer as they talk to
the computer. At the end of the consultation the student goes away to consider their options.

What is the purpose in this rhetorical situation?

A. To defer for six months from university
B. To talk to an administrative staff member
C. To consult texts on a computer

D. To give advice and assistance to students with issues surrounding their enrolment and other related
matters at university
