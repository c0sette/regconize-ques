Consider the following argument.

There are numerous examples of people struggling to remove squatters due to the inadequacy of the law. For
example, Imran Lakhani, despite finding squatters on his property while working overseas, struggled for 6
months to remove the squatters in his house. Dale Morrison faced similar issues too when she and her family
returned from holiday to find squatters in their house. These cases clearly demonstrate that laws against
squatting on private property should be tightened. Of course, these changes would only apply to private
property to retain people's right to protest on public land.
