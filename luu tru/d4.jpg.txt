Consider the following situation.

Mohammed is a third-year undergraduate student studying epidemiology. His professor is highly regarded
the field and Mohammed is very excited to study under him. However, after seeing another student use an
incorrect equation while trying to replicate one of his professor's experiments, Mohammed notices that his
professor made a small error when calculating the data for the original experiment. When Mohammed fixes
the error, it changes the results so much that the conclusion isn't correct anymore. Mohammed checks the
original and his own multiple times but he still gets the same result.

Mohammed is very concerned because the paper with the published results of the experiments his profess
did has been referenced many times.

What should Mohammed do?

A. Bring this to his professor's attention as soon as possible
B. Go to the head of the school and tell her that his professor has been falsifying his results

C. Do nothing. Mohammed obviously isn't doing the calculations properly as his professor is much more
intelligent and knows much more about the subject than he does

D. He should go to the dean of the faculty and report his professor's experiment
