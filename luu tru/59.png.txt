Although it's easy to see why allowing an elementary school child to have a cell phone would be convenient for
after-school pickups or arranging playdates with friends, there is too much evidence to show that it's generally
not a good idea. Children already have a lot of access to media (on average over seven hours per day) and it
is the parent's responsibility to monitor their media access, which is more difficult if the child has exclusive cell
phone access. Cyber bullying, which is increasingly becoming a problem, is also going to be a risk when your
child has unlimited access to a smart phone. Clearly, elementary school-aged children are not emotionally
mature enough to handle the responsibility of a smart phone, and the borrowing of a parent's cell phone
should be highly monitored to ensure safe and healthful usage.
